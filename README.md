# OSPractice
Practice working with Open Source Repositories

## Objective
This repository (repo) is designed for me and others to practice working with Open Source
Projects/Repos/Code and interacting with the other contributors as well as the owner with
comments and pull requests.

## Scope
Feel free to create issues, or address issues of any kind including adding, corecting or
even redesigning this readme.

## Longevity
I plan to monitor this repo as long as it serves my purpose to learn and experiment and 
as long as others appear to be actively interacting with it. I will try to find some mannor
of notification to indicate a date of deletion once it seems appropriate.

## Code Languages
Feel free to use code in any language, however if you are interested in me evaluating or
testing it, my prefered language is currently C#.
